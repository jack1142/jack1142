ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

If you're on this profile, you probably knew me on GitHub by my old username - jack1142.

Since I go by Jackenmen on pretty much every other platform, I've renamed my GitHub account to [@Jackenmen](https://github.com/Jackenmen) to match it.

If you're linking to any of my repositories, I suggest updating your URLs to use the new username.<br>
However, as long as I own this account, [all of my old repository URLs should keep redirecting to the new repository URLs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/changing-your-github-username#repository-references).
